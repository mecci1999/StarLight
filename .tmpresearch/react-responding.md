title: Responding to Events

<Intro>

React lets you add *event handlers* to your JSX. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

## Adding event handlers {/*adding-event-handlers*/}

To add an event handler, you will first define a function and then [pass it as a prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to the appropriate JSX tag. For example, here is a button that doesn't do anything yet:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Button() {
  return (
    <button>
      I don't do anything
    </button>
  );
}
```

</Sandpack>

You can make it show a message when a user clicks by following these three steps:

1. Declare a function called `handleClick` *inside* your `Button` component.
2. Implement the logic inside that function (use `alert` to show the message).
3. Add `onClick={handleClick}` to the `<button>` JSX.

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-right: 10px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You defined the `handleClick` function and then [passed it as a prop](/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to `<button>`.  `handleClick` is an **event handler.** Event handler functions:

* Are usually defined *inside* your components.
* Have names that start with `handle`, followed by the name of the event.

By convention, it is common to name event handlers as `handle` followed by the event name. You'll often see `onClick={handleClick}`, `onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}`, and so on.

Alternatively, you can define an event handler inline in the JSX:

```jsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

Or, more concisely, using an arrow function:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

All of these styles are equivalent. Inline event handlers are convenient for short functions.

<Pitfall>

Functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called. For example:

| passing a function (correct)     | calling a function (incorrect)     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `<button onClick={handleClick}>` | `<button onClick={handleClick()}>` |

The difference is subtle. In the first example, the `handleClick` function is passed as an `onClick` event handler. This tells React to remember it and only call your function when the user clicks the button.

In the second example, the `()` at the end of `handleClick()` fires the function *immediately* during [rendering](/learn/render-and-commit), without any clicks. This is because JavaScript inside the [JSX `{` and `}`](/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces) executes right away.

When you write code inline, the same pitfall presents itself in a different way:

| passing a function (correct)            | calling a function (incorrect)    |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>` | `<button onClick={alert('...')}>` |


Passing inline code like this won't fire on click—it fires every time the component renders:

```jsx
// This alert fires when the component renders, not when clicked!
<button onClick={alert('You clicked me!')}>
```

If you want to define your event handler inline, wrap it in an anonymous function like so:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert('You clicked me!')}>
```

Rather than executing the code inside with every render, this creates a function to be called later.

In both cases, what you want to pass is a function:

* `<button onClick={handleClick}>` passes the `handleClick` function.
* `<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>` passes the `() => alert('...')` function.

## Event propagation {/*event-propagation*/}

Event handlers will also catch events from any children your component might have. We say that an event "bubbles" or "propagates" up the tree: it starts with where the event happened, and then goes up the tree.

### Stopping propagation {/*stopping-propagation*/}

Event handlers receive an **event object** as their only argument. By convention, it's usually called `e`, which stands for "event". You can use this object to read information about the event.

That event object also lets you stop the propagation. If you want to prevent an event from reaching parent components, you need to call `e.stopPropagation()` like this `Button` component does:

<Sandpack>

```js
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```css
.Toolbar {
  background: #aaa;
  padding: 5px;
}
button { margin: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

### Preventing default behavior {/*preventing-default-behavior*/}

Some browser events have default behavior associated with them. For example, a `<form>` submit event, which happens when a button inside of it is clicked, will reload the whole page by default:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Signup() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => alert('Submitting!')}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>

You can call `e.preventDefault()` on the event object to stop this from happening:

<Sandpack>

```js
export default function Signup() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={e => {
      e.preventDefault();
      alert('Submitting!');
    }}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

```css
button { margin-left: 5px; }
```

</Sandpack>
