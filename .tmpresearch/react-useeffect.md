<Intro>

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you [synchronize a component with an external system.](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)

```js
useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
```

</Intro>

## Reference {/*reference*/}

### `useEffect(setup, dependencies?)` {/*useeffect*/}

Call `useEffect` at the top level of your component to declare an Effect:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
    };
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

#### Parameters {/*parameters*/}

* `setup`: The function with your Effect's logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a *cleanup* function. When your [component commits](/learn/render-and-commit#step-3-react-commits-changes-to-the-dom), React will run your setup function. After every commit with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. After your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

## Usage {/*usage*/}

### Connecting to an external system {/*connecting-to-an-external-system*/}

Some components need to stay connected to the network, some browser API, or a third-party library, while they are displayed on the page. These systems aren't controlled by React, so they are called *external.*

To [connect your component to some external system,](/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) call `useEffect` at the top level of your component:

```js [[1, 8, "const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);"], [1, 9, "connection.connect();"], [2, 11, "connection.disconnect();"], [3, 13, "[serverUrl, roomId]"]]
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { createConnection } from './chat.js';

function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {
  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');

  useEffect(() => {
  	const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.connect();
  	return () => {
      connection.disconnect();
  	};
  }, [serverUrl, roomId]);
  // ...
}
```

**React calls your setup and cleanup functions whenever it's necessary, which may happen multiple times:**

1. Your setup code runs when your component is added to the page.
2. After every commit where the dependencies have changed:
   - First, your cleanup code runs with the old props and state.
   - Then, your setup code runs with the new props and state.
3. Your cleanup code runs one final time after your component is removed from the page.

**To help you find bugs, in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the setup.** This is a stress-test that verifies your Effect's logic is implemented correctly. If this causes visible issues, your cleanup function is missing some logic. The cleanup function should stop or undo whatever the setup function was doing.

### Listening to a global browser event {/*listening-to-a-global-browser-event*/}

In this example, the external system is the browser DOM itself. Normally, you'd specify event listeners with JSX, but you can't listen to the global `window` object this way. An Effect lets you connect to the `window` object and listen to its events. Listening to the `pointermove` event lets you track the cursor (or finger) position and update the red dot to move with it.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity: 0.6,
      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}
```

### Wrapping Effects in custom Hooks {/*wrapping-effects-in-custom-hooks*/}

Effects are an escape hatch: you use them when you need to step outside React and when there is no better built-in solution.
